Prioritize companies showing: (1) Strong relative strength vs sector index, (2) Institutional accumulation patterns, (3) Solid fundamentals (earnings growth, ROE >12%, healthy balance sheet), (4) Adequate liquidity for RM50,000 portfolio deployment, (5) Favorable risk-reward at current valuations. Ensure representation from all three sectors with slight overweight to Technology and Finance given stronger capital inflow dynamics."
