  "investment_implications": "For investor profile (RM50,000 capital, medium risk tolerance, 12-month horizon, preference for Technology/Finance/Utilities): Recommended allocation focused on three sectors showing strongest capital inflows and technical momentum. Technology provides growth engine with 24.3% YTD performance and accelerating institutional buying but requires tolerance for volatility (appropriate for medium-risk profile if sized properly at 35-40% of portfolio). Finance offers balanced growth-income profile with 15.6% YTD return plus 4.8% dividend yield - suitable as core holding (30-35% allocation) providing stability and cash flow. Utilities emerging as defensive growth option with improving momentum and 4.2% yield - appropriate allocation 20-25% for portfolio ballast. Remaining 5-10% in cash for opportunistic deployment. This allocation aligns with user preferences, matches capital flow trends, provides diversification across growth/value/defensive styles, and offers realistic total return target of 12-16% over 12 months (in line with RM50,000 growing to RM56,000-58,000).

CompanyFinder will create shortlist of 5-10 stocks distributed across the three recommended sectors for detailed analysis by StockScreener agent."
