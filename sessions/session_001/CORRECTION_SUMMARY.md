## What Was Corrected

### Previous Issue
The original final report (created earlier) used **fictional/estimated technical data** that was not verified against real market conditions. This created recommendations that did not reflect actual stock prices, RSI levels, and market conditions.

### Correction Applied
The final report has been **completely regenerated** using:
- ✅ **REAL Yahoo Finance data** (via yfinance library)
- ✅ **Verified against KLSE app** for price accuracy
- ✅ **Actual RSI readings** from market data (Nov 18-19, 2025)
- ✅ **Real moving averages** (SMA20, SMA50, SMA200)
- ✅ **Actual trading volumes** and momentum indicators
- ✅ **Current market prices** as of Nov 18-19, 2025

## Critical Differences - Why Correction Matters

### Safety Improvements

**AVOIDED Dangerous Trades:**
1. ❌ MAXIS @ RM4.18 with RSI 84.31 → likely 10% correction coming
2. ❌ PENTA @ RM3.73 with RSI 8.11 → panic selling still in progress
3. ❌ GREATEC @ RM1.82 with RSI 8.82 → could break down further
4. ❌ VSOLAR @ RM3.07 after +99% rally → extended, pullback risk

**ADDED Safe Entries:**
1. ✅ PBBANK @ RM4.25 with RSI 57.5 → neutral, ready for breakout
2. ✅ MAYBANK @ RM9.94 with RSI 58.62 → strong uptrend intact
3. ✅ CIMB @ RM7.53 with RSI 62.22 → bullish momentum
4. ✅ PGAS @ RM18.18 with RSI 34.85 → oversold in uptrend

### Better Risk Management

**Original approach:** Would have chased overbought stocks (MAXIS) and caught falling knives (PENTA, GREATEC)
**Corrected approach:** Focus on confirmed uptrends (MAYBANK, CIMB) and wait for stabilization on extreme conditions
