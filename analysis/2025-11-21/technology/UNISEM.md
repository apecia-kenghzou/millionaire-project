## 6. ACTION RECOMMENDATION

### Primary Recommendation: **SCALE IN GRADUALLY**

**Entry Timing:** IMMEDIATE (scale in 40-40-20 approach)

**Rationale:**
1. **AI Semiconductor Tailwind** - Pure-play OSAT exposure to AI chip testing boom
2. **Accelerating Growth** - Q3 growth of 21.5% YoY shows AI demand kicking in
3. **Technical Oversold** - RSI 31.96 suggests near-term bottom approaching
4. **Strong Fundamentals** - 8.2 fundamental score with 14.8% ROE
5. **Long-term Uptrend** - Still 30% above SMA200, correction healthy

**Why Scale-In (Not Full Position)?**
- RSI oversold but no reversal confirmation yet
- MACD still bearish (negative histogram)
- Could test RM3.00 support before reversing
- Gradual accumulation reduces timing risk

**Maximum Portfolio Risk:** 0.83% (if stop loss hit)

### 8.3 Profit Targets (Take Profits Systematically)

**Target 1: RM 3.50 (+9.7% gain)**
- Exit: 30% of position (sell ~360 shares)
- Timing: 1-3 months estimated
- Rationale: Lock initial gains at SMA20 resistance

**Target 2: RM 3.75 (+17.6% gain)**
- Exit: 40% of position (sell ~480 shares)

## 9. INVESTMENT THESIS

### 9.1 Bull Case (Why Invest)

**AI Semiconductor Megatrend:**
1. **Pure-Play OSAT Exposure** - Direct beneficiary of AI chip testing demand surge
2. **Accelerating Growth** - 21.5% YoY Q3 growth proves AI impact materializing
3. **Capacity Constraints** - Global OSAT shortage benefits pricing and utilization
4. **Technology Leadership** - Advanced packaging capabilities for AI chip requirements

**Operational Excellence:**
- 14.8% ROE demonstrates efficient capital allocation
- Strong FCF generation (RM 58.2M) despite growth capex
- Healthy balance sheet (0.52x D/E) enables expansion
- Geographic diversification reduces single-market risk

**Valuation Opportunity:**
- Stock down 11.6% from highs despite accelerating fundamentals
- PE 19.2x reasonable for 16-21% growth profile
- Technical oversold (RSI 31.96) creates entry opportunity
- AI theme has multi-year runway (not one-quarter wonder)

### 9.2 Bear Case (Key Risks)

**Semiconductor Cycle Risk:**
- OSAT industry highly cyclical - boom-bust patterns
- If AI chip demand slows, testing volumes would decline rapidly
- Customer inventory adjustments cause revenue volatility

**Customer Concentration:**
- Likely dependent on 3-5 major customers for significant revenue
- Loss of key customer would materially impact results
- Limited pricing power against large fabless customers

**Execution Risk:**
- Capacity expansion requires significant capex investment
- Technology transitions (advanced packaging) carry execution risk
- Competition from larger OSAT players (ASE, Amkor)

**Valuation Risk:**
- If AI boom narrative fades, stock could de-rate quickly
- PE 19.2x vulnerable if growth disappoints
- Broader semiconductor downturn would impact multiples

### 9.3 Thesis Summary

**Core Thesis:** Pure-play OSAT company positioned at center of AI semiconductor testing boom with accelerating growth (21.5% YoY) and strong ROE (14.8%). Technical correction creates opportunity to accumulate quality growth company at oversold levels. Multi-year AI infrastructure build-out provides sustained demand visibility.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH (on fundamentals and AI theme)

**Time Horizon:** 12-18 months to capture AI boom

## 11. SUMMARY & QUICK REFERENCE

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Price** | RM 3.19 |
| **Recommendation** | SCALE IN (40-40-20) |
| **Entry Zone** | RM 2.85 - 3.19 (scale gradually) |
| **Stop Loss** | RM 2.75 (firm, non-negotiable) |
| **Target 1** | RM 3.50 (exit 30%) |
| **Target 2** | RM 3.75 (exit 40%) |
| **Target 3** | RM 4.10 (exit 30%) |
| **Position Size** | 6% (RM 3,000) |
| **Max Risk** | 0.83% of portfolio |
| **Time Horizon** | 12-18 months |
| **Risk Level** | Medium-High |

**Bottom Line:** UNISEM is a pure-play AI semiconductor testing beneficiary with accelerating growth (21.5% YoY Q3) and strong fundamentals (8.2 score). Current technical weakness (RSI 31.96 oversold, -11.6% from high) creates attractive entry opportunity. Scale in gradually over 2-4 weeks to build 6% position. AI boom provides multi-year tailwind but semiconductor cyclicality requires strict stop loss discipline at RM 2.75.
