## 7. INVESTMENT THESIS

Best-in-class automation equipment provider with outstanding 18.2% ROE and fortress balance sheet. Dual growth drivers from semiconductor industry capex and new solar/EV automation markets. Accelerating momentum (32% earnings growth Q3 2025) shows execution. Long customer relationships and order visibility provide downside protection.

- Diversified customer base across semiconductors, automotive, industrial, solar/EV
- 18+ month order book provides revenue visibility

**Key Concerns:**
- PE ratio elevated at 23.8x reflects premium valuation - growth must sustain
