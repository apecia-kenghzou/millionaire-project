## 6. ACTION RECOMMENDATION

### **WAIT FOR STABILIZATION - DO NOT BUY YET**

**Current Status:** WATCHLIST (Zero allocation)

**Why WAIT?**
1. RSI 8.82 = EXTREME panic selling (like PENTA)
2. Testing CRITICAL 200-day SMA - could break down
3. No volume reversal signal yet
4. Could fall to RM 1.60 if 200SMA fails

**What We're Watching For:**
- RSI recovery above 20 (minimum)
- Volume spike (2x+) on UP day
- Price holding above RM 1.75 for 3-5 days
- Preferably bounce OFF 200-day SMA with volume

---

## 7. ENTRY STRATEGY (AFTER Stabilization)

### Conditional Entry Plan

**IF Stabilization Signals Appear:**

**Tranche 1 (50% = RM 1,250):** RM 1.75-1.85 after RSI > 20
**Tranche 2 (50% = RM 1,250):** RM 1.80-1.90 on RSI > 30 confirmation

**Target Position:** 5-7% (RM 2,500-3,500) after stabilization

**Entry Triggers Required:**
1. RSI sustained above 20 for 2+ days
2. Price holds RM 1.75 (does NOT break 200SMA)
3. Volume surge on bounce (2-3x average)

**CRITICAL:** Only enter AFTER stabilization - NOT NOW

---

## 8. RISK MANAGEMENT

### Stop Loss (IF Entered Post-Stabilization)
**Stop Loss:** RM 1.60 (below 200-day SMA breakdown)
**Risk:** ~10% from RM 1.80 entry
**Max Portfolio Risk:** 0.5-0.7% (5-7% position × 10% stop)

### Profit Targets (After Entry)
- **Target 1:** RM 2.05 (+12.6%) - Exit 30%
- **Target 2:** RM 2.25 (+23.6%) - Exit 40%
- **Target 3:** RM 2.50 (+37.4%) - Exit 30%

## 9. INVESTMENT THESIS

### Bull Case
**"Quality Growth at Panic Price"**
- HIGHEST revenue growth (19.5% CAGR) in entire portfolio
- Q3 momentum strong: 22.5% revenue, 28.3% earnings
- Conservative balance sheet (0.28x D/E) provides flexibility
- 18-month order book = revenue visibility
- RSI 8.82 panic creates potential multi-year entry IF stabilizes

### Bear Case
**"Why RSI 8.82?"**
- Something fundamentally wrong market hasn't disclosed?
- Smaller scale (RM 2.95B market cap) vulnerable in downturns
- Customer concentration risk
- PE 20.3x elevated for stock in breakdown
- Solar/EV market entry execution risk

### Thesis Summary
**Quality growth company in extreme technical distress at critical 200-day SMA support. IF stabilization occurs with volume reversal, represents opportunity. BUT panic suggests unknown fundamental issue OR sector-wide breakdown. PATIENCE CRITICAL - wait for confirmation.**

**Confidence:** HIGH (fundamentals), VERY LOW (near-term technicals)
