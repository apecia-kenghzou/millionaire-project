## 7. INVESTMENT THESIS

National electricity monopoly offering defensive characteristics with stable regulated returns. Exceptional cash generation (FCF RM6.3B) supports 4.5% dividend yield with growth potential. Renewable energy transition (RM25B capex) creates long-term growth optionality aligned with government decarbonization goals. Government backing provides implicit downside protection.

- Low growth (3.5% CAGR) reflects mature regulated monopoly - limited upside
- ROE of 8.5% at low end of allowed range (6-8%) - efficiency room exists
- Current ratio of 0.85 tight - working capital pressure from capex
