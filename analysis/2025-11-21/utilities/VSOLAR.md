## RECOMMENDATION: **WAIT FOR PULLBACK**
**Current:** ZERO (0%) | **Target:** RM 2.80-2.95 after 10-15% correction

**WHY WAIT?**
- Stock doubled (+99%) = extended, needs consolidation
- Better entry 10-15% lower offers superior risk/reward
- Fundamentals excellent BUT timing poor after parabolic rally
- Patience = better entry

**IF Corrects to RM 2.80-2.95:** 5-7% position (RM 2,500-3,500)

## THESIS

- HIGHEST growth (24.5% CAGR) with pure-play solar exposure
- Malaysia 70% RE target by 2050 = secular tailwind
- 21-year PPAs provide revenue stability
- BUT: Stock doubled, wait for pullback to 2.80-2.95

**Action:** Watchlist. Set alert RM 2.95. Wait for 10-15% correction. NO POSITION now.
