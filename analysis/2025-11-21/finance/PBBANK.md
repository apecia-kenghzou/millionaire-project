## 10. WARNINGS & CRITICAL NOTES

### Important Considerations

**This is NOT a Growth Stock:**
- 7.8% revenue CAGR = mature bank growth
- Don't expect 20-30% returns
- This is a QUALITY + INCOME play (10-15% capital + 4.9% dividend = 15-20% total)

**Stop Loss is MANDATORY:**
- Set stop at RM 4.05 on day of purchase
- Below this level, breakout pattern fails
- Accept 4.7% loss if triggered (capital preservation)

**Monitor Quarterly Results:**
- Watch for NPL deterioration (above 1.2% = concern)
- Monitor net interest margin trends
- Check for large provisioning charges

### Weekly Monitoring
- [ ] Price holding above RM 4.20? (breakout pattern intact)
- [ ] Volume remaining elevated? (accumulation continuing)
- [ ] Banking sector news (regulatory changes, rate moves)
- [ ] Any profit warnings or negative news

### Exit Triggers (Beyond Stop Loss)
- NPL ratio rises above 1.2% for 2 quarters
- Net margin compression below 16%
- Major regulatory changes increasing capital requirements
- Property market collapse (>20% decline)
