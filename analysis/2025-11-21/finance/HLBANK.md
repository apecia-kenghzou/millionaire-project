**Rationale:** Strong fundamentals + uptrend BUT liquidity risk restricts size

## 7. ENTRY STRATEGY
**Single Entry:** RM 20.60-20.90 (~120 shares, RM 2,500)

## 9. THESIS
**"Efficiency Champion Limited by Liquidity"**
- BEST efficiency (38% C/I) and margins (17.8%) in sector
- Focused SME strategy creates competitive moat with loyal customers
- Strong uptrend near 52w high (+17.3% from low)
- BUT: Low liquidity (1.57M avg volume) = position size capped at 5%

**Bull:** Operational excellence + profitability + uptrend = quality small position
**Bear:** Low liquidity creates entry/exit difficulty, smaller scale, SME concentration, slow growth (5.5%)

**CRITICAL LIQUIDITY WARNING:** RM 2,500 position = 119 shares. Avg volume 1.57M means position is 0.008% of daily volume. However, larger positions (>5%) would be difficult to exit quickly. **MAXIMUM 5% allocation due to liquidity constraints.**

- Average volume only 1.57M shares (~RM 33M daily value)
- Difficult to enter/exit large positions without moving market
- In crisis, might not be able to sell at desired price
- **Never exceed 5% of portfolio in this stock**

**Monitor:** SME credit quality, efficiency ratio maintenance, any volume spikes
