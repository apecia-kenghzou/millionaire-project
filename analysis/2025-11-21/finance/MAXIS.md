## 6. RECOMMENDATION: **WAIT FOR PULLBACK - DO NOT BUY NOW**

**Current Status:** ZERO ALLOCATION (0%)
**Target Entry:** RM 3.80-3.95 (after 10-15% correction)

**WHY WAIT?**
1. **RSI 84.31 = EXTREME overbought** - Correction likely imminent
2. **At 52w high** - Poor entry timing after +37% rally
3. **Low volume** - Rally exhaustion signs
4. **Better entry 10-15% lower** at RM 3.80-3.95

**DO NOT CHASE AT RM 4.18** - Fundamentals excellent BUT entry timing terrible

## 7. ENTRY STRATEGY (AFTER Correction)

**WAIT FOR RSI < 65 and 10% pullback**

**IF/WHEN Price Corrects to RM 3.80-3.95:**
**Primary Entry (70%):** RM 3.80-3.90 (~720 shares, RM 2,800)
**Secondary Entry (30%):** RM 3.70-3.80 (~310 shares, RM 1,200)
**Target Position:** 8% (RM 4,000) AFTER correction

**Entry Triggers:**
- RSI drops below 65
- Price pulls back to RM 3.80-3.95 (10-15% correction)
- Volume spike on bounce (buyers stepping in)

**Stop (if entered):** RM 3.65 (12.7% risk from RM 4.18, but only 6% from RM 3.88 entry)

## 8. TARGETS (After Entry at 3.80-3.95)
**T1:** RM 4.35 (+10-14%) - Exit 30% | **T2:** RM 4.60 (+17-21%) - Exit 40% | **T3:** RM 4.90 (+25-29%) - Exit 30%
**Return:** 15-25% + 5.8% dividend = 21-31% total (IF entered at correction)

## 9. THESIS
**"Best Fundamentals at Wrong Time"**

**Why World-Class:**
- **HIGHEST ROE (24.5%)** = Most efficient capital allocator in portfolio
- **HIGHEST dividend (5.8%)** = Best income generation
- **Exceptional margins (23.2%)** = Premium positioning
- **Strong FCF (RM 2.15B)** = Supports dividend and debt reduction
- **Market leader (40%+ share)** = Pricing power and network advantage

**Why WAIT:**
- RSI 84.31 parabolic = Correction coming (historical pattern)
- At 52w high after +37% = Late to rally
- Low volume = Momentum fading
- Better entry 10-15% lower offers 20-30% better risk/reward

**Bull Case (at RM 3.80):** Best ROE + Best dividend + Premium franchise = Core holding
**Bear Case:** Mature market (5.8% CAGR), telco disruption, regulatory pressure, bought at top = poor returns

**CRITICAL:** This is a **"RIGHT STOCK, WRONG TIME"** situation. Patience = Key.

## 10. WARNINGS - **READ CAREFULLY**

**DO NOT BUY AT RM 4.18 - THIS IS CRITICAL:**
- RSI 84.31 seen only 1-2% of days (extreme)
- Stock at all-time 52w high
- Historical pattern: RSI >80 followed by 10-15% correction within 2-4 weeks
- Buying now = catching last 5% of rally, risking 15% correction

**PATIENCE REQUIRED:**
- Add to watchlist, monitor DAILY
- Wait for RSI drop below 70, ideally 65
- Wait for price pull back to RM 3.80-3.95
- Could take 2-4 weeks (or longer) for correction
- Opportunity will still be there AFTER pullback

**What If It Keeps Going Up?**
- Better to miss 10% upside than catch 15% downside
- Quality company will have future opportunities
- Don't let FOMO override discipline

## 11. SUMMARY
