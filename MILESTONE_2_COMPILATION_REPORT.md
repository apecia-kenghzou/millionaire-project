- Solar/EV automation market wins (18+ month order backlog)
- Margin expansion as operational leverage kicks in
- M&A opportunities with RM1.8B+ cash war chest

**Critical Note:** PENTA was previously ranked #11 due to EXTREME oversold (RSI 8.11). NOW UPGRADED TO TOP OPPORTUNITY as RSI recovered to 31.9. This is the **BEST BUY on Nov 21** - act before RSI exceeds 40.

## RISKS AND MITIGATION

### Portfolio Risks

1. **Market-Wide Correction**
   - **Risk:** Overall market downturn affects all holdings
   - **Mitigation:** 24% cash reserve, defensive sector bias (56% Finance+Utilities), 4.85% yield cushion

2. **Sector Rotation**
   - **Risk:** Money flows out of current sectors
   - **Mitigation:** Diversification across 3 sectors, quality companies can withstand rotation

3. **Economic Slowdown**
   - **Risk:** GDP slowdown impacts earnings growth
   - **Mitigation:** Banking fortress fundamentals (PBBANK 0.89% NPL), regulated utilities, defensive positioning

4. **Individual Stock Risks**
   - **Risk:** Company-specific issues (PENTA semiconductor cycle, INARI customer concentration)
   - **Mitigation:** Stop losses on all positions, scale-in strategies reduce concentration, diversification across 7+ stocks

### Risk Management Rules

1. **Stop Losses:** Strictly enforced on all positions (4-7% below entry)
2. **Position Sizing:** No single stock > 13% (PBBANK largest at 13%)
3. **Cash Reserve:** Maintain 15-20% minimum cash at all times
4. **Rebalancing:** Monthly review, trim winners, add to losers if thesis intact
5. **Avoid Extremes:** Do not chase overbought (MAXIS RSI 75) or falling knives (GREATEC RSI 21)
