milestone 1: 
instead of session we can do by daily or weekly. folder by date, then within date folder contain each file that represent that share . for example PBBANK or the 4 code .md  file inside contains the information and analysis for that share.  we won't look at all share but we will look at maybe top 10 for each sector. 
the information or analysis will be similar on what currently done. 

milestone 2: 
gather the generated information and compile into which of the company have high return, or worth to invest. 

milestone 3:
generate a website that have a dashboard to show an overview of the informations, like what are the top few company worth invest,  what is the money flowing, maybe can show something like water flow diagram. 
searchable using 4 code or name to get the recent information that u generated . in md . 

milestone 4:
u will have a json file where u put in the share that u suggest to buy and keep track those share. u will have a capital and also paper gain and paper loss. you will mark ur performance for each day. 

milestone 5: 
generate me a md file that is to prompt you to gather all the information again. you also will decide from ur current holding whether to let go and buy new share. all this information will be shown in the website too.

milestone 6: 
generate me a md file for u to improve ur agents within .claude/agents folder. in this milestone u should have the capability to understand ur weakness and improve ur agents, or create new agents. when this happens u should able to modify the md file that created in the 5th milestone

milestone 7: 
once everything is stable we can consider moving to use proper software stacks, having a reactjs frontend , a mariadb database, and also a nodejs express backend, nginx serving. with dockerize modern architecture. 

notes: 
- u should have the permission to improve the website until what u desire. 
- when there is no information found in the internet u should able to say no data found 
- our target is keep improving
- sometimes news is good but we wont go extend as at the end affect is still visible in the share market

bonus:
- if u need gather data by using script like yahoo library. feel free to write a python based code and write me a md file with instruction how should i properly proceed on the data collection like when should i run the script, daily? and how to run it. so that it will gather all the data u need.
